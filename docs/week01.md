# Week 1: Introduction to AI and Intelligent Agents

## üìö Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Define artificial intelligence and understand its historical development
- Distinguish between narrow and general AI
- Understand the concept of intelligent agents and the PEAS framework
- Identify different types of agent environments
- Recognize key AI applications in modern technology

## üß† What is Artificial Intelligence?

![AI Timeline](images/ai-timeline.png)

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the science of making machines act intelligently. But what does "acting intelligently" mean?

### Historical Perspectives on AI

#### 1. **Thinking Humanly** (Cognitive Science Approach)
- Model human thought processes
- Understand how the human mind works
- Example: Cognitive architectures that simulate human reasoning

#### 2. **Acting Humanly** (Turing Test Approach)  
- Pass the Turing Test - convince a human interrogator that the machine is human
- Focus on external behavior rather than internal processes
- **Alan Turing (1950):** "Can machines think?"

#### 3. **Thinking Rationally** (Laws of Thought Approach)
- Use logical reasoning and formal logic
- Aristotelian syllogisms and mathematical proof
- Problem: Not all intelligent behavior is logical

#### 4. **Acting Rationally** (Rational Agent Approach) ‚≠ê
- **Current dominant paradigm**
- Do the "right thing" given available information
- Maximize expected performance based on goals

## ü§ñ Intelligent Agents

### What is an Agent?

An **agent** is anything that can be viewed as:
- **Perceiving** its environment through **sensors**
- **Acting** upon the environment through **actuators**

![Agent Environment Diagram](images/intelligent-agent-diagram.png)

### The PEAS Framework

To design any AI system, we must specify:

| Component | Description | Example: Autonomous Car |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **P**erformance | What constitutes success? | Safe, fast, legal driving; passenger comfort |
| **E**nvironment | What is the agent's world? | Roads, traffic, weather, pedestrians |
| **A**ctuators | How can the agent act? | Steering, brakes, accelerator, horn, signals |
| **S**ensors | What can the agent perceive? | Camera, GPS, speedometer, engine sensors |

### Programming Example: Simple Reflex Agent

```python
class SimpleReflexAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = {
            'dirty': 'suck',
            'clean': 'move'
        }
    
    def perceive(self, environment):
        """Get current state from sensors"""
        return environment.get_current_state()
    
    def act(self, percept):
        """Choose action based on current percept"""
        if percept in self.rules:
            return self.rules[percept]
        return 'no_action'

# Example usage
agent = SimpleReflexAgent()
current_state = 'dirty'
action = agent.act(current_state)
print(f"State: {current_state}, Action: {action}")  # Output: State: dirty, Action: suck
```

### Types of Agent Environments

#### 1. **Observable vs. Partially Observable**
- **Fully Observable:** Chess (can see entire board)
- **Partially Observable:** Poker (can't see opponents' cards)

#### 2. **Deterministic vs. Stochastic**
- **Deterministic:** Chess (outcomes are certain given actions)
- **Stochastic:** Backgammon (dice introduces randomness)

#### 3. **Episodic vs. Sequential**
- **Episodic:** Email classification (each email independent)
- **Sequential:** Chess (current move affects future positions)

#### 4. **Static vs. Dynamic**
- **Static:** Crossword puzzle (doesn't change while thinking)
- **Dynamic:** Taxi driving (world changes continuously)

#### 5. **Discrete vs. Continuous**
- **Discrete:** Chess (finite number of moves)
- **Continuous:** Taxi driving (infinite steering angles)

#### 6. **Single Agent vs. Multi-agent**
- **Single:** Puzzle solving
- **Multi-agent:** Chess, autonomous driving

2. How would you define the PEAS framework for a web search engine?
3. What are the challenges in creating truly general AI?
4. Should AI systems be transparent in their decision-making? When and why?
