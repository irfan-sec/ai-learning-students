## ðŸ¤– Welcome to Artificial Intelligence!

This first week sets the foundation for our entire AI journey. We'll explore what artificial intelligence really means, how it has evolved, and introduce the fundamental concept of **intelligent agents** - the building blocks of AI systems.

## ðŸ“š What You'll Learn

### Core Topics

1. **Definition and History of AI**
   - What is artificial intelligence?
   - Key milestones in AI development
   - Different approaches to AI

2. **Intelligent Agents**
   - Agent function and architecture
   - Perception and action in environments
   - The PEAS framework (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors)

3. **Types of Environments**
   - Observable vs. partially observable
   - Deterministic vs. stochastic
   - Static vs. dynamic
   - Discrete vs. continuous

4. **Agent Types**
   - Simple reflex agents
   - Model-based agents
   - Goal-based agents
   - Utility-based agents

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Activities

### Required Reading
- **AIMA Chapter 1:** Introduction to AI
- **AIMA Chapter 2:** Intelligent Agents (sections 2.1-2.4)

### Hands-on Practice
- Design your first intelligent agent
- Analyze real-world AI systems using the PEAS framework
- Implement a simple reflex agent in Python

## ðŸ”¬ Practical Applications

### Real-World Examples
- **Autonomous Vehicles:** How do self-driving cars perceive and act?
- **Recommendation Systems:** How does Netflix choose what to show you?
- **Game Playing:** What makes AlphaGo intelligent?
- **Virtual Assistants:** How do Siri and Alexa understand and respond?

## ðŸ’¡ Key Questions to Consider

- What makes a system "intelligent"?
- How do we measure the performance of an AI agent?
- What are the ethical considerations when designing AI systems?
- How do different environments affect agent design?

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Read the foundational materials** linked in the sidebar
2. **Watch the introductory videos** in the resources section
3. **Complete the exercises** to test your understanding
4. **Experiment with the code examples** to see agents in action

## ðŸ”— Connections to Future Weeks

This week's concepts will be essential throughout the course:
- **Week 2-4:** Search algorithms help agents find solutions
- **Week 7+:** Machine learning enables agents to improve performance
- **Week 13:** Ethics in AI considers the societal impact of intelligent agents
