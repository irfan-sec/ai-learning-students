# Week 5: Knowledge Representation & Reasoning I (Logic)

## üìö Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Understand the principles of knowledge representation in AI
- Work with propositional logic and first-order logic
- Implement basic inference algorithms
- Apply logical reasoning to solve AI problems
- Design knowledge bases for expert systems

---

## üß† What is Knowledge Representation?

Knowledge representation is a fundamental area of AI that deals with how to formally encode information about the world in a form that AI systems can use to make decisions and solve problems.

### Key Components
- **Syntax:** How to write statements in the language
- **Semantics:** What those statements mean in the world
- **Inference:** How to derive new knowledge from existing knowledge

---

## üî§ Propositional Logic

### Basic Concepts
- **Propositions:** Statements that are either true or false
- **Logical Connectives:** AND (‚àß), OR (‚à®), NOT (¬¨), IMPLIES (‚Üí), BICONDITIONAL (‚Üî)
- **Truth Tables:** Define meaning of logical connectives

### Example Implementation

```python
class PropositionalLogic:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = set()
    
    def add_rule(self, rule):
        """Add a logical rule to the knowledge base"""
        self.knowledge_base.add(rule)
    
    def query(self, proposition):
        """Query whether a proposition is true given the KB"""
        # Implementation would involve inference algorithms
        pass
```

---

## üéØ First-Order Logic (Predicate Logic)

First-order logic extends propositional logic by introducing:
- **Objects:** Things in the world (people, places, concepts)
- **Relations:** Relationships between objects
- **Functions:** Mappings from objects to objects
- **Quantifiers:** Universal (‚àÄ) and existential (‚àÉ)

### Example: Family Relationships

```python
# Facts about family relationships
facts = [
    "Parent(John, Mary)",
    "Parent(John, Tom)", 
    "Parent(Mary, Alice)",
    "Male(John)",
    "Male(Tom)",
    "Female(Mary)",
    "Female(Alice)"
]

# Rules for deriving new relationships
rules = [
    "‚àÄx,y Parent(x,y) ‚Üí Ancestor(x,y)",
    "‚àÄx,y,z Parent(x,y) ‚àß Ancestor(y,z) ‚Üí Ancestor(x,z)",
    "‚àÄx,y Parent(x,y) ‚àß Male(x) ‚Üí Father(x,y)",
    "‚àÄx,y Parent(x,y) ‚àß Female(x) ‚Üí Mother(x,y)"
]
```

---

## üîç Inference Algorithms

### Forward Chaining
- Start with facts and apply rules to derive new facts
- Continue until no more facts can be derived or goal is reached

### Backward Chaining
- Start with goal and work backwards to find supporting facts
- Used in many expert systems

### Resolution Theorem Proving
- Convert statements to clause form
- Apply resolution rule to derive contradictions
- Used in automated theorem provers

## üíª Hands-On Exercise: Simple Expert System

```python
class SimpleExpertSystem:
    """A basic expert system using propositional logic"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.facts = set()
        self.rules = []
    
    def add_fact(self, fact):
        """Add a known fact"""
        self.facts.add(fact)
    
    def add_rule(self, condition, conclusion):
        """Add an if-then rule"""
        self.rules.append((condition, conclusion))
    
    def infer(self):
        """Apply forward chaining to infer new facts"""
        changed = True
        while changed:
            changed = False
            for condition, conclusion in self.rules:
                if self.evaluate_condition(condition) and conclusion not in self.facts:
                    self.facts.add(conclusion)
                    changed = True
    
    def evaluate_condition(self, condition):
        """Evaluate if a condition is satisfied by current facts"""
        # Simplified evaluation - in practice would parse logical expressions
        return condition in self.facts
    
    def query(self, fact):
        """Query if a fact can be inferred"""
        self.infer()
        return fact in self.facts

# Example: Medical diagnosis system
expert_system = SimpleExpertSystem()

# Add symptoms as facts
expert_system.add_fact("fever")
expert_system.add_fact("cough")
expert_system.add_fact("headache")

# Add diagnostic rules
expert_system.add_rule("fever", "possible_infection")
expert_system.add_rule("possible_infection", "recommend_rest")
expert_system.add_rule("cough", "respiratory_symptoms")

# Query the system
if expert_system.query("recommend_rest"):
    print("System recommends rest")
```
