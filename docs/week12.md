# Week 12: AI in Practice & Selected Topics

## üìö Learning Objectives
- Explore modern AI applications in industry
- Understand Natural Language Processing (NLP) fundamentals
- Learn computer vision applications
- Discuss AI deployment and MLOps practices
- Survey current AI research directions

---

## üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Text Processing Pipeline
From raw text to machine-readable features.

```python
import nltk
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from transformers import pipeline

# Basic text preprocessing
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Tokenization, lowercasing, removing punctuation
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text.lower())
    # Remove stopwords and punctuation
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalpha()]
    return ' '.join(tokens)

# Modern NLP with transformers
sentiment_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
result = sentiment_pipeline("I love this AI course!")
print(result)  # [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998}]
```

### Applications
- Sentiment analysis
- Machine translation
- Question answering systems
- Chatbots and virtual assistants

## üëÅÔ∏è Computer Vision

### Image Classification and Object Detection
Teaching machines to see and understand images.

```python
import cv2
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions

# Pre-trained image classification
model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

# Load and preprocess image
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
img = cv2.resize(img, (224, 224))
img = preprocess_input(img.reshape(1, 224, 224, 3))

# Make prediction
predictions = model.predict(img)
results = decode_predictions(predictions, top=3)[0]
```

---

## üöÄ AI in Production (MLOps)

### Model Deployment Pipeline
Moving from research to production.

```python
# Example Flask API for model serving
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import joblib
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)
model = joblib.load('trained_model.pkl')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    features = np.array(data['features']).reshape(1, -1)
    prediction = model.predict(features)[0]
    confidence = model.predict_proba(features)[0].max()
    
    return jsonify({
        'prediction': int(prediction),
        'confidence': float(confidence)
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key MLOps Concepts
- Model versioning and experiment tracking
- Continuous integration/deployment for ML
- Model monitoring and drift detection
- A/B testing for model performance
