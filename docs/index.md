## üéØ Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Define AI** and describe the major subfields and applications
2. **Formulate real-world problems** as search problems and implement algorithms to solve them (uninformed search, informed search, adversarial search)
3. **Understand the principles** of knowledge representation and logical reasoning
4. **Explain basic concepts** of probability theory for uncertain reasoning
5. **Describe core concepts** of machine learning, including different learning paradigms
6. **Implement and train** basic supervised learning models (linear regression, classification, neural networks)
7. **Recognize societal and ethical implications** of AI technology
