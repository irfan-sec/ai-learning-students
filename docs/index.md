## 📖 Course Description

This course provides a broad introduction to the fundamental principles and techniques of Artificial Intelligence. Students will explore the core concepts of intelligent agents, problem-solving through search, game playing, knowledge representation, reasoning, and machine learning. The course combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation using Python programming.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- **Understand** the fundamental concepts and history of artificial intelligence
- **Implement** various search algorithms for problem-solving
- **Design** intelligent agents for different environments
- **Apply** machine learning techniques to real-world problems
- **Evaluate** the ethical implications of AI systems
- **Develop** practical AI applications using Python
