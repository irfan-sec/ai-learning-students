## üìù Content Style Guide

### Writing Style
- **Conversational but Professional:** Write as if explaining to a friend
- **Active Voice:** "We implement the algorithm" vs "The algorithm is implemented"
- **Consistent Terminology:** Use the same terms as the AIMA textbook when possible
- **Code Comments:** Explain what the code does, not just how

### Markdown Formatting
- Use `#` for main headings, `##` for sections, `###` for subsections
- Include code blocks with language specification: ```python
- Use bullet points for lists and numbered lists for sequential steps
- Add alt text for all images: `![Description](image-url)`

### Code Standards
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Follow Python style guidelines
- **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Documentation:** Include docstrings for functions and classes
- **Error Handling:** Add basic error checking where appropriate
