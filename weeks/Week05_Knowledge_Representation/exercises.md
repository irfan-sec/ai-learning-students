## üìù Propositional Logic Exercises

### Exercise 1: Logical Translation

Translate the following English statements into propositional logic. Define your propositions clearly.

**Scenario:** A smart home system with sensors and devices.

**Propositions to define:**
- `R` = Rain is detected
- `W` = Windows are open  
- `H` = Heating is on
- `C` = Air conditioning is on
- `M` = Motion is detected
- `L` = Lights are on

**Translate these statements:**

1. "If it's raining and the windows are open, then close the windows."
   - **Your answer:** ________________________________

2. "The heating and air conditioning are never on at the same time."
   - **Your answer:** ________________________________

3. "If motion is detected, turn on the lights, unless it's daytime."
   - **Your answer:** ________________________________ (add `D` = Daytime)

4. "The system is in eco-mode if and only if no motion is detected and it's daytime."
   - **Your answer:** ________________________________ (add `E` = Eco-mode)

### Exercise 2: Truth Tables

Create truth tables for the following formulas:

**Formula A:** `(P ‚Üí Q) ‚Üî (¬¨P ‚à® Q)`

| P | Q | P‚ÜíQ | ¬¨P | ¬¨P‚à®Q | (P‚ÜíQ)‚Üî(¬¨P‚à®Q) |
|---|---|-----|----|----- |---------------|
| T | T |     |    |      |               |
| T | F |     |    |      |               |
| F | T |     |    |      |               |
| F | F |     |    |      |               |

**Formula B:** `¬¨(P ‚àß Q) ‚Üî (¬¨P ‚à® ¬¨Q)`

| P | Q | P‚àßQ | ¬¨(P‚àßQ) | ¬¨P | ¬¨Q | ¬¨P‚à®¬¨Q | ¬¨(P‚àßQ)‚Üî(¬¨P‚à®¬¨Q) |
|---|---|-----|--------|----|----|-------|-----------------|
| T | T |     |        |    |    |       |                 |
| T | F |     |        |    |    |       |                 |
| F | T |     |        |    |    |       |                 |
| F | F |     |        |    |    |       |                 |

### Exercise 3: Model Checking Practice

Given this knowledge base about a university:
```
KB = {

    StudentTakesMath ‚Üí GoodWithNumbers,
    ¬¨(GoodWithComputers ‚àß GoodWithNumbers)
}
```

## üåç First-Order Logic Exercises

### Exercise 4: FOL Translation

Translate these English statements into First-Order Logic:

**Translate:**

1. "All students are enrolled in at least one course."

2. "No student teaches a course."
   - **Your answer:** ________________________________

3. "Every course is taught by exactly one professor."
   - **Your answer:** ________________________________

4. "A student can only enroll in a course if they have completed all prerequisites."
   - **Your answer:** ________________________________

5. "There exists a student who has completed all courses."
   - **Your answer:** ________________________________

### Exercise 5: Quantifier Scope

For each formula, identify the scope of each quantifier and determine which variables are bound vs. free:

1. `‚àÄx (Student(x) ‚Üí ‚àÉy (Course(y) ‚àß Enrolled(x,y)))`
   - **Scope of ‚àÄx:** ________________________________
   - **Scope of ‚àÉy:** ________________________________
   - **Bound variables:** ________________________________
   - **Free variables:** ________________________________

2. `‚àÄx ‚àÉy (Teaches(x,y) ‚Üí Professor(x)) ‚àß Student(z)`
   - **Scope of ‚àÄx:** ________________________________
   - **Scope of ‚àÉy:** ________________________________
   - **Bound variables:** ________________________________
   - **Free variables:** ________________________________

### Exercise 6: Simple Model Checker

Implement a basic model checker in Python:

```python
def evaluate_formula(formula, model):
    """
    Evaluate a propositional logic formula given a model.
    
    Args:
        formula: String representation (e.g., "P and Q")
        model: Dictionary mapping variables to boolean values
    
    Returns:
        Boolean value of the formula
    """
    # TODO: Implement this function
    pass

def model_check(kb_formulas, query_formula):
    """
    Check if KB entails query using model checking.
    
    Args:
        kb_formulas: List of formula strings representing KB
        query_formula: String representing the query
    
    Returns:
        True if KB entails query, False otherwise
    """
    # TODO: Implement this function
    # Hint: Generate all possible models and check each one
    pass

# Test your implementation
kb = ["P or Q", "P implies R", "Q implies R"]
query = "R"
result = model_check(kb, query)
print(f"Does KB entail {query}? {result}")
```

**Your implementation:** Complete the functions above.

### Exercise 7: Knowledge Base Builder

Create a simple knowledge base for the Wumpus World:

```python
class WumpusKB:
    def __init__(self):
        self.facts = set()
    
    def tell(self, fact):
        """Add a fact to the knowledge base"""
        # TODO: Implement
        pass
    
    def ask(self, query):
        """Query the knowledge base"""
        # TODO: Implement basic inference
        pass
    
    def add_breeze_rule(self, x, y):
        """Add rule: Breeze at (x,y) iff pit in adjacent cell"""
        # TODO: Implement
        pass

# Example usage
kb = WumpusKB()
kb.tell("not Pit_1_1")  # Agent starts safely
kb.tell("not Breeze_1_1")  # No breeze observed
kb.add_breeze_rule(1, 1)  # Add the breeze rule

# What can we infer?
print(kb.ask("not Pit_1_2"))  # Should we avoid (1,2)?
```
