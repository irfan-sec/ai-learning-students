## üí° Study Tips and Best Practices

### Understanding Probability
- **Practice calculations:** Do many examples by hand
- **Visualize:** Draw Venn diagrams and probability trees
- **Check intuition:** Does the answer make sense?
- **Use real examples:** Connect to everyday situations

### Bayesian Networks
- **Start simple:** Begin with 2-3 variable networks
- **Draw it out:** Always sketch the network structure
- **Verify independence:** Check conditional independence assumptions
- **Test inference:** Calculate simple queries by hand first

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Confusing P(A|B) with P(B|A):** Remember they're different!
- **Assuming independence:** Don't assume without justification
- **Ignoring normalization:** Probabilities must sum to 1
- **Wrong chain rule:** Get the conditioning right

### Debugging Probabilistic Code
- **Check probabilities:** All should be between 0 and 1
- **Verify normalization:** Distributions should sum to 1
- **Test simple cases:** Use networks you can solve by hand
- **Print intermediate values:** Track probability calculations
