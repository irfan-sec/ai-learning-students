## üìù Conceptual Questions

### Question 1: Defining Intelligence
**Scenario:** You encounter four different definitions of AI:
1. "Systems that think like humans"
2. "Systems that act like humans" 
3. "Systems that think rationally"
4. "Systems that act rationally"

**Tasks:**
a) Match each definition to one of the four historical approaches to AI
b) Give a modern example of a system that fits each category
c) Which approach is most dominant in current AI research and why?

### Question 2: Agent Identification
**Consider these systems:**
- A smoke detector
- Netflix recommendation system  
- A GPS navigation system
- A vending machine
- Autocorrect on your phone

**Tasks:**
a) Which of these would you classify as intelligent agents? Justify your reasoning.
b) For those you classified as agents, what makes them "intelligent"?
c) What would need to be added to make the non-agents more "intelligent"?

## üèóÔ∏è PEAS Framework Practice

### Exercise 1: Autonomous Vacuum Cleaner
**Scenario:** Design an autonomous vacuum cleaner robot for home use.

**Your Task:** Define the PEAS framework:

| Component | Your Definition |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Performance** | |
| **Environment** | |
| **Actuators** | |
| **Sensors** | |

**Follow-up Questions:**
1. How might the PEAS definition change for an industrial vacuum robot?
2. What trade-offs exist between performance measures (e.g., cleaning thoroughness vs. battery life)?

### Exercise 2: Medical Diagnosis System  
**Scenario:** An AI system that helps doctors diagnose diseases from patient symptoms.

**Complete the PEAS framework:**
- **Performance:** ___________________________
- **Environment:** ___________________________  
- **Actuators:** ___________________________
- **Sensors:** ___________________________

**Critical Thinking:**
- How would you measure the performance of such a system?
- What ethical considerations arise with this application?

## ü§ù Discussion Prompts

### Discussion 1: The Turing Test Today
**Prompt:** "In 1950, Alan Turing proposed that a machine could be considered intelligent if it could fool a human in conversation. Today, we have chatbots that can sometimes pass the Turing Test, but we don't consider them truly intelligent."

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Is the Turing Test still a valid measure of intelligence? Why or why not?
2. What limitations does the Turing Test have?
3. What would be a better test of machine intelligence for modern AI systems?
4. Should we focus more on useful AI rather than human-like AI?

### Discussion 2: AI Everywhere
**Prompt:** "AI is becoming increasingly embedded in everyday life - from recommendation algorithms to voice assistants to navigation systems."

**Discussion Questions:**
1. List 5 AI systems you interacted with in the past week
2. How has AI changed your daily routines in the past 5 years?  
3. What are the benefits and drawbacks of this AI integration?
4. Are there areas of life where you think AI should not be used? Why?

## üî¨ Hands-on Exploration

### Exercise 6: Agent Behavior Observation
**Task:** Interact with three different AI systems and analyze their behavior as agents.

**Suggested Systems:**
- Voice assistant (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
- Navigation app (Google Maps, Waze)
- Recommendation system (Netflix, Spotify, YouTube)
- Chatbot (customer service, ChatGPT)

**For each system, document:**
1. **Inputs:** What information does it use?
2. **Outputs:** How does it respond or act?
3. **Learning:** Does it seem to adapt to your usage?
4. **Limitations:** What can't it do well?
5. **Agent Classification:** Is it reactive, goal-based, or utility-based?

## üèÜ Challenge Problems (Optional)

### Challenge 1: Environment Design
Design an environment that is simultaneously:
- Partially observable but deterministic
- Sequential but episodic (think carefully about this!)
- Multi-agent but static

Explain how this is possible and give a concrete example.

### Challenge 2: Intelligence Metrics
Propose three specific, measurable criteria for evaluating whether an AI system is "intelligent." Explain why these criteria are better than the Turing Test for modern applications.

**üí° Study Tips:**
- Review the textbook examples of agent designs
- Try to relate every concept to something you use in daily life
- Don't just memorize definitions - understand the underlying principles
- Practice explaining concepts to others to test your understanding

**üîó Next Week Preview:** We'll learn how agents can solve problems by searching through possible actions and states. Start thinking about how you would program an agent to find the shortest path between two locations!
