**Complete this formulation:**
- **Initial State:** ________________________________
- **Actions:** ____________________________________
- **Transition Model:** ___________________________
- **Goal Test:** __________________________________  
- **Path Cost:** __________________________________

#### Scenario B: Course Scheduling
A student needs to create a schedule for 5 courses, with each course offered at multiple time slots, avoiding conflicts.

**Your formulation:**

## üå≥ Search Tree Analysis

### Exercise 2: Search Tree Construction

Consider this simple graph representing cities and roads:

```
    A --- B --- D
    |     |     |
    C --- E --- F
```

Starting from city A, wanting to reach city F, with each road having cost 1:

**Tasks:**
1. **Draw the search tree** for BFS (show order of node expansion)
2. **Draw the search tree** for DFS (assume alphabetical ordering: B before C)
3. **Show the path** found by each algorithm
4. **Count total nodes expanded** by each algorithm

**BFS Tree:**
```
[Draw your tree here - use text format like:]
Level 0: A
Level 1: B, C
Level 2: ...
```

**DFS Tree:**
```
[Draw your tree here]
```

**Analysis:**
- Which algorithm found the shorter path?
- Which algorithm expanded fewer nodes? 
- Would the results change if F was at a different location?

## üîç Algorithm Tracing

### Exercise 3: Step-by-Step Algorithm Execution

Given this graph with edge costs:

```
      2
  A ------> B
  |         |
 3|         |1  
  |         |
  v    4    v
  C ------> D
```

Goal: Find path from A to D using Uniform-Cost Search.

**Complete this trace table:**

| Step | Frontier (node:cost) | Current | Goal? | Expanded? | New Children |
|------|---------------------|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | A:0 | - | - | - | - |
| 1 | | A | No | Yes | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |

**Questions:**
1. What path did UCS find?
2. What was the total cost?
3. Why didn't UCS take the direct A‚ÜíC‚ÜíD path?

## ‚ö° Algorithm Comparison

### Exercise 4: Performance Analysis

For the 8-puzzle problem with this initial state:
```
Initial:    Goal:
1 2 3      1 2 3
4 _ 6      4 5 6  
7 5 8      7 8 _
```

**Theoretical Analysis:**
1. **State Space Size:** How many possible states are there? (Hint: 9! positions, but not all reachable)

2. **Branching Factor:** What's the average branching factor for the 8-puzzle?

3. **Algorithm Comparison:** Fill in this table for finding the optimal solution:

| Algorithm | Complete? | Optimal? | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | 
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| BFS | | | | |
| DFS | | | | |
| IDS | | | | |
| UCS | | | | |

**Practical Questions:**
4. Which algorithm would you choose if you had unlimited memory?
5. Which algorithm would you choose if memory was severely limited?
6. Why might IDS be better than both BFS and DFS for this problem?

## üíª Implementation Exercises

### Exercise 5: Code Implementation

**Task:** Implement breadth-first search for a simple grid world.

**Grid Layout (0 = free, 1 = obstacle):**
```python
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], 
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
start = (0, 0)  # top-left
goal = (4, 4)   # bottom-right
```

**Your Implementation:**
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_grid_search(grid, start, goal):
    """
    Find shortest path in grid using BFS.
    
    Args:
        grid: 2D list where 0=free, 1=obstacle
        start: (row, col) starting position  
        goal: (row, col) goal position
        
    Returns:
        List of (row, col) positions from start to goal,
        or None if no path exists
    """
    # TODO: Implement BFS here
    # Remember to:
    # 1. Use a queue for the frontier
    # 2. Keep track of visited cells
    # 3. Store parent pointers to reconstruct path
    # 4. Check bounds and obstacles
    
    pass  # Replace with your implementation

# Test your implementation
path = bfs_grid_search(grid, start, goal)
print(f"Path found: {path}")
print(f"Path length: {len(path) if path else 'No path'}")
```

**Extension Questions:**
1. Modify your code to also implement DFS - what differences do you observe?
2. Add a function to visualize the path on the grid
3. What happens if you change the start or goal positions?

### Exercise 6: 8-Puzzle by Hand

**Initial State:**

2 8 3
1 6 4  
7 _ 5
```

**Goal State:**
```
1 2 3
8 _ 4
7 6 5  
```

**Tasks:**
1. **Solve by hand** - find any solution sequence (list the moves)
2. **Apply BFS approach** - what would be the first few states explored?
3. **Estimate nodes expanded** - how many states would BFS need to explore?

**Your Solution Sequence:**
```
Move 1: ____________________
Move 2: ____________________  
Move 3: ____________________
...
```

**BFS First States (show first 3 levels):**
```
Level 0: [Initial state]
Level 1: [States after 1 move]
Level 2: [States after 2 moves]  
```

### Exercise 7: Pathfinding in Games

**Scenario:** In a simple dungeon crawler game, a player character needs to navigate from the entrance to the treasure while avoiding monsters.

```
E . . M .
. M . . .
. . M . .  
M . . . T
```

**Questions:**
1. **Formulate as search problem:** Define states, actions, goal test
2. **Safety vs. Speed:** How would you modify the path cost to balance avoiding monsters vs. finding short paths?
3. **Dynamic monsters:** If monsters move, how does this change the problem type?
4. **Algorithm choice:** Which search algorithm would be best for real-time pathfinding?

**Your Analysis:**
- **Problem formulation:** ________________________________

        times.append(end_time - start_time)  
        memory_peaks.append(peak)
