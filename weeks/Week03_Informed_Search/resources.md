## üí° Study Tips and Best Practices

### Understanding Heuristics
- **Start Simple:** Begin with Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance
- **Visualize:** Draw out how heuristics guide the search
- **Experiment:** Try different heuristics on the same problem
- **Prove Properties:** Verify admissibility and consistency mathematically

### Debugging A*
- **Track the Open List:** Monitor which nodes are being explored
- **Verify f-values:** Check f(n) = g(n) + h(n) calculations
- **Test on Simple Cases:** Start with small grids before complex problems
- **Compare with Dijkstra:** A* with h=0 should match Dijkstra's algorithm

### Performance Optimization
- **Use Priority Queues:** Essential for efficient implementation
- **Consider Memory:** A* can use lots of memory; try IDA* for large spaces
- **Profile Your Code:** Identify bottlenecks in your implementation
- **Learn from Games:** Game developers have optimized A* extensively
